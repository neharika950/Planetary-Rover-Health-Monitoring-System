Effective Mars rover operations rely on accurately assessing environmental and system
performance parameters to ensure reliability and mission success in the harsh Martian environment.
Fuzzy logic provides a robust framework to handle the uncertainties and imprecise data associated with these conditions.
This section outlines the design of a fuzzy logic system, including membership functions for key environmental and rover component parameters, to evaluate the rover’s operational health and identify potential risks.
By integrating these parameters, the system ensures informed decision-making to optimize performance and extend mission longevity.

Fuzzy Logic Design and Membership Functions
The following membership functions are defined for evaluating the rover's environmental and operational conditions:

Environmental and System Performance Parameters
The following membership functions are designed to assess environmental and system performance parameters, focusing on temperature, sensor functionality, and communication status to ensure optimal rover operations.

Temperature
•	Low (L): [0, 0, 15] — Low temperatures may cause stress, affecting battery and sensor performance.
•	Normal (N): [10, 25, 35] — Ideal temperature range for optimal rover performance.
•	High (H): [30, 50, 100] — High temperatures risk overheating and damage to electronics.

  Sensor Functionality
•	Malfunctioning (MF): [0, 0, 40] — Sensor failure or incorrect data.
•	Functional (F): [30, 70, 100] — Sensor operating normally.
•	Fully Functional (FF): [90, 100, 100] — Sensor performing at peak efficiency.

 Communication Status
•	Poor (P): [0, 0, 40] — Unreliable communication.
•	Fair (F): [30, 60, 80] — Occasional communication issues.
•	Good (G): [70, 100, 100] — Strong and stable communication.

Rover Component Parameters
The following membership functions evaluate the condition of the rover's key components:

Battery Health
•	Low (L): [0, 0, 20] — severely degraded battery health or poor performance.
•	Medium (M): [15, 50, 85] — Represents average or functional battery health
•	High (H): [30, 50, 100] — Represents excellent battery health.
•	

Motor Performance
•	Weak (W): [0, 0, 30] — Low power output, possibly due to wear or failure.
•	Normal (N): [20, 60, 90] — Standard motor performance.
•	Strong (S): [80, 100, 100] — High efficiency and optimal performance.

              Wheel Condition
•	Poor (P): [0, 0, 30] — Severe wear or damage, affecting movement.
•	Fair (F): [20, 50, 80] — Moderate wear, may impact mobility.
•	Good (G): [70, 100, 100] — Optimal condition for efficient movement.
